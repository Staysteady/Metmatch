## UX Expert Prompt

"Review the Met Match PRD focusing on the UI/UX Design Goals section. Create detailed wireframes for the main trading dashboard showing the 75/25 split layout with activity table and MarketBroadcastWidget. Ensure all designs follow the centralized theme system defined in lib/theme.ts with consistent color tokens and the dark theme (#0F1419 background). Pay special attention to the widget as the design system source of truth."

## Architect Prompt

"Create a comprehensive technical architecture document for Met Match based on this PRD. Focus on: 1) Detailed system architecture using the specified monorepo structure with React/TypeScript frontend and Node.js/Express backend, 2) Database schema design for PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM migrations, 3) WebSocket architecture using Socket.io for <100ms latency with 1000+ concurrent connections, 4) Security architecture with JWT authentication and 7-year audit retention, 5) API design following RESTful principles with OpenAPI documentation. Ensure all technical decisions align with the constraints of solo development with AI assistance."
