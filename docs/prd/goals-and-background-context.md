# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Enable electronic trading communication between brokers, traders, and market makers on the LME, replacing inefficient phone-based workflows
- Provide instant multi-directional RFQ capabilities allowing any participant type to request quotes from others  
- Create network transparency showing who's trading, their capabilities, and market-making status in real-time
- Reduce RFQ response times from 2-5 minutes (phone) to under 30 seconds through electronic routing
- Establish compliance-ready platform with complete audit trails for all trading activities
- Deliver cost-effective alternative to Bloomberg terminals at fraction of the cost (£500-2000/month vs £24,000/year)
- Build scalable platform architecture ready for expansion beyond LME to other asset classes and markets
- Achieve critical mass of 100+ paying subscribers within 6 months leveraging existing LME member relationships

## Background Context

Met Match addresses the fundamental inefficiency in commodities trading where billions in volume operates through outdated phone calls and fragmented chat systems. Despite LME members having established due diligence relationships, traders lack visibility into counterparties' capabilities and availability, resulting in missed opportunities and slow execution. The platform leverages these existing relationships while providing the electronic infrastructure needed for modern trading, positioning itself as complementary to exchange trading by focusing on pre-trade communication and price discovery. With increasing regulatory scrutiny demanding better audit trails and the global shift toward electronic trading, Met Match provides a timely solution that transforms trading connectivity without requiring clearing or settlement capabilities.
