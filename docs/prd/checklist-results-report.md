## Top Issues by Priority

**BLOCKERS:** None

**HIGH:**
- Data model and schema details should be defined before development begins
- API endpoint specifications needed for public API implementation

**MEDIUM:**
- Customer support chatbot implementation details not specified
- White-label customization options not fully detailed

**LOW:**
- Phase 2 features (squawk box, mobile) mentioned but not fully scoped
- Telemetry dashboard specifications could be more detailed

## MVP Scope Assessment

**Features Appropriately Scoped:**
- Core trading functionality (RFQ, orders, market broadcasting)
- Essential user management and authentication
- Required compliance and audit features
- Real-time WebSocket infrastructure

**Complexity Appropriate:**
- 22 stories achievable by solo developer with AI assistance
- Each story sized for 2-4 hour development sessions
- Clear acceptance criteria prevent scope creep

**Timeline Realistic:**
- 6-month MVP timeline achievable with focused development
- Sequential epic structure allows incremental delivery
- Foundation established before complex features

## Technical Readiness

**Clear Technical Constraints:**
- Monorepo structure defined
- Tech stack specified (React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Performance requirements quantified (<100ms WebSocket latency)
- Security requirements established (JWT, bcrypt, 7-year audit retention)

**Identified Technical Risks:**
- WebSocket scalability beyond 1000 concurrent users needs testing
- 7-year audit retention requires robust archival strategy
- Real-time performance under high load needs validation

**Areas for Architect Investigation:**
- Optimal WebSocket architecture for scale
- Audit log storage and retrieval strategy
- Schema migration approach with Drizzle ORM

## Recommendations

1. **Before Development Starts:**
   - Create detailed data model diagram
   - Define all API endpoints with request/response schemas
   - Establish WebSocket event protocol documentation

2. **During Epic 1:**
   - Set up comprehensive logging and monitoring
   - Establish testing framework with CI/CD pipeline
   - Create development environment documentation

3. **Continuous Improvements:**
   - Maintain story completion velocity tracking
   - Regular user feedback sessions after Epic 3
   - Performance benchmarking after Epic 4

## Final Decision

**âœ… READY FOR ARCHITECT:** The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. The document provides clear business requirements, technical constraints, and user stories that can guide implementation.
