# Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE

Establish the core platform foundation with authentication, authorization, and basic UI structure to enable all subsequent development.

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (2025-09-07)

## Story 1.1: Project Setup & Development Environment

As a developer,
I want a properly configured monorepo with all necessary dependencies,
so that I can begin building the platform with a consistent development environment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Monorepo structure created with packages/frontend, packages/backend, packages/shared
2. TypeScript configuration with strict mode enabled across all packages
3. Docker Compose configuration for PostgreSQL (port 5434) and Redis (port 6380)
4. Vite configured for frontend development on port 3000
5. Express server configured for backend on port 3001
6. ESLint and Prettier configured with consistent rules
7. Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore
8. Package.json scripts for concurrent development (npm run dev starts all services)

## Story 1.2: JWT Authentication System

As a user,
I want to securely log in with email and password,
so that I can access the platform with my authenticated identity.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Login endpoint accepts email/password and returns JWT + refresh token
2. Passwords hashed using bcrypt with 12 salt rounds
3. JWT tokens expire after 15 minutes, refresh tokens after 7 days
4. Refresh endpoint exchanges valid refresh token for new JWT
5: Logout endpoint invalidates refresh token in Redis
6. Protected route middleware validates JWT on all authenticated endpoints
7. Login attempts rate-limited to 5 per minute per IP
8. Secure httpOnly cookies used for token storage

## Story 1.3: Role-Based Access Control

As a platform administrator,
I want users to have role-based permissions,
so that features are appropriately restricted based on user type.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Four roles implemented: TRADER, TRADER_MM (with market making), BROKER, ADMIN
2. Role stored in JWT token and database user record
3. Middleware enforces role-based access to API endpoints
4. Frontend routes protected based on user role
5. Role changes require admin permission and create audit log entry
6. Default permissions auto-assigned based on role at registration
7. Role visible in user profile and admin panel

## Story 1.4: Base UI Shell & Theme System

As a user,
I want a consistent dark-themed interface,
so that I can use the platform comfortably during extended trading sessions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Dark theme implemented with #0F1419 background color
2. Centralized theme.ts file with all color tokens and variants
3. Main layout with collapsible left navigation sidebar
4. Header with user profile dropdown and logout option
5. SF Pro font stack configured for optimal readability
6. Tailwind CSS configured with custom color palette
7. All components reference theme.ts tokens (no local color definitions)
8. 75/25 split layout prepared for activity table and widget
