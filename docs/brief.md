# Project Brief: Met Match

## Executive Summary

Met Match is a professional trading platform that connects brokers, traders, and platform market makers in the financial industry through comprehensive trading workflows including RFQs (Request for Quotes), order management, market broadcasting, voice integration, and sophisticated relationship management capabilities. Designed as a cost-effective alternative to expensive Bloomberg terminals, Met Match addresses the critical problem of outdated communication methods in financial trading by providing an electronic platform that enables rapid response times, high transparency, and compliance-ready logging. 

The platform targets market professionals in the commodities sector initially (focusing on the London Metal Exchange), with plans to expand into equities and crypto markets. Unlike traditional phone-based interactions or limited chat rooms, Met Match creates a visible, searchable network where users can instantly identify who's trading, their capabilities, market-making status, and broker relationships—fundamentally transforming how financial professionals discover and connect with counterparties.

## Problem Statement

The financial trading industry operates on fundamentally outdated technology and workflows that create significant inefficiencies and missed opportunities. Currently, broker-dealer interactions rely heavily on telephone calls and fragmented messaging services like Bloomberg and Reuters chat rooms, where traders must actively search for specific counterparties without visibility into their trading capabilities, market-making status, or availability. This archaic system results in:

- **Limited counterparty discovery**: Category 1 LME members don't know all traders at Category 4 members, and vice versa, despite having existing due diligence in place
- **Slow response times**: Phone-based RFQs and order management create delays in fast-moving markets
- **Lack of transparency**: No centralized view of who's actively trading, what products they handle, or their market-making capabilities
- **Compliance challenges**: Phone conversations and scattered chat messages make audit trails complex and incomplete
- **High costs**: Bloomberg terminals cost ~$24,000/year per user while only providing generic communication tools not optimized for trading workflows
- **Inefficient price discovery**: Brokers can only reach limited market makers they personally know, while market makers miss potential flow from unfamiliar brokers

The impact is substantial: billions in trading volume operates through inefficient channels, regulatory compliance requires expensive manual processes, and market participants miss profitable opportunities due to limited network visibility. The urgency is heightened by increasing regulatory scrutiny requiring better audit trails and the competitive pressure as markets become more electronic globally.

## Proposed Solution

Met Match revolutionizes financial trading connectivity through a purpose-built electronic platform that creates a transparent, searchable marketplace where all participants can discover and transact with each other efficiently. The platform combines:

**Core Trading Functionality:**
- Multi-directional RFQ system where traders, market makers, and brokers can all request quotes from each other (brokers can RFQ market makers to find markets, market makers can RFQ other market makers, etc.)
- Full order management system with real-time execution and confirmation workflows
- Market broadcasting capabilities showing trading interests and activity
- Voice integration via squawk box functionality, bringing the energy and theater of traditional trading floors into the electronic platform world

**Network Intelligence:**
- Dynamic trader profiles showing real-time status (active/away), trading capabilities, and product coverage
- Clear identification of user types: Traders, Traders with market-making capabilities, Brokers, and Admins (with full visibility and control)
- Instant visibility into who's trading what, replacing the current blind spots in the market
- Smart routing of RFQs to relevant participants based on their product expertise and current activity

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Purpose-built for trading workflows** unlike generic chat platforms or expensive Bloomberg terminals
- **Leverages existing relationships** - starting with markets where due diligence between participants often already exists
- **Network amplification** - each participant gains access to all verified counterparties on the platform, though due diligence must be confirmed before trading is enabled
- **Compliance-first architecture** with every interaction logged, searchable, and audit-ready
- **Subscription model** at a fraction of Bloomberg costs while delivering superior trading-specific functionality
- **Scalable and product-agnostic** - designed to work across multiple asset classes and markets, not limited to any single exchange or product type

The solution succeeds where others haven't by focusing exclusively on the trading workflow rather than trying to be a general communication platform, leveraging existing regulatory frameworks while maintaining flexibility for expansion, and creating immediate value through network effects - the platform becomes more valuable to each user as more verified counterparties join.

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

- **Timeline:** MVP must launch within 6 months to capture LME market opportunity, Phase 2 features within 12 months to maintain competitive advantage
- **Resources:** Solo developer with AI assistance via Claude Code, no dedicated DevOps or support team initially
- **Technical:** No direct exchange data feeds initially (manual market data entry), limited to browser-based platform (no native apps), cannot store actual trade execution/settlement data (compliance boundary), initial development on local MacBook Pro environment
- **Regulatory:** Must maintain audit trails for 7 years per financial regulations, cannot provide investment advice or recommendations, must comply with data residency requirements for UK/EU
- **Business:** Subscription-only model initially (no transaction fees due to regulatory complexity), limited to English language for MVP, focus on LME members only for first year

### Key Assumptions

- LME members already have established due diligence relationships, reducing onboarding friction
- Traders are frustrated with current phone-based workflows and actively seeking electronic solutions  
- Market makers want broader distribution for their prices but lack efficient channels
- Regulatory environment will remain stable enough to allow platform operation without major licensing
- Users will adopt subscription model at £500-2000/month as cost-effective vs Bloomberg terminals
- WebSocket technology will provide sufficient reliability for mission-critical trading communications
- Squawk box feature will recreate enough trading floor atmosphere to drive adoption
- Platform can achieve network effects with 20-30 initial power users who bring their networks
- White-label architecture will attract larger firms wanting private-labeled solutions
- Solo developer with AI assistance can deliver MVP quality platform within 6-month timeline
- Local development environment will be sufficient for MVP development and testing
- Migration to cloud infrastructure (AWS) can be deferred until post-launch
- Browser-based platform will be acceptable to professional traders (no native app requirement)

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **Exchange Opposition Risk:** Exchanges may resist the platform as they try to drive more transparency and activity on their own trading platforms. Mitigation: Position as complementary to exchange trading, focus on pre-trade communication and price discovery
- **User Adoption Risk:** Traders may resist changing from familiar phone-based workflows despite inefficiencies. Mitigation: Focus on power users who can influence others, emphasize time savings and compliance benefits
- **Network Effect Dependency:** Platform value depends on achieving critical mass of users quickly. Mitigation: Target specific LME trading desks as complete units, leverage existing relationships between members
- **Technical Complexity:** Real-time trading platform with WebSocket requires high reliability and low latency. Mitigation: Extensive testing, graceful degradation, redundant connection handling
- **Regulatory Changes:** Financial regulations could require unexpected licensing or compliance changes. Mitigation: Build flexible audit system, maintain dialogue with compliance experts, design for adaptability
- **Competitive Response:** Bloomberg or existing players could quickly replicate features. Mitigation: Move fast, focus on trading-specific workflows they ignore, build strong user relationships
- **Solo Developer Bandwidth:** Single developer may face challenges with 24/7 support expectations. Mitigation: Clear SLA expectations, automated monitoring and alerts, comprehensive documentation
- **Data Security Breach:** Financial platform is high-value target for cyber attacks. Mitigation: Security-first development, regular penetration testing, encryption at all layers
- **Platform Reliability:** Trading downtime could severely damage reputation. Mitigation: Comprehensive testing, staged rollout, immediate rollback capabilities

### Open Questions

- Should we pursue FCA authorization early or operate under existing member authorizations? (Worth investigating)
- What is the optimal integration approach for sending trade confirmations to front office and back office systems?
- How do we handle disputes or errors in trades? (Platform will provide quick retrieval of all activity for resolution)
- What level of live customer support will be needed beyond the automated chatbot for complex issues?
- How do we manage the transition from automated chatbot to live assistance seamlessly?
- What integration points do existing trading systems absolutely require for confirmation delivery?
- How do we ensure trade confirmations reach all required parties (front office, back office, compliance)?
- What backup communication channels are needed if primary confirmation delivery fails?

### Areas Needing Further Research

- Specific API requirements for integration with existing OMS/EMS systems
- Optimal WebSocket architecture for scaling beyond 1000 concurrent connections
- Legal structure for operating across multiple jurisdictions
- Voice synthesis quality and latency for squawk box feature via ElevenLabs (Phase 2)
- Backup and disaster recovery requirements for 7-year audit retention
- Performance benchmarks from existing trading platforms for comparison
- User research on most frustrating aspects of current phone-based trading
- Technical requirements for FIX protocol implementation in Phase 2
- White-label implementation patterns that maintain data isolation
- Chatbot AI implementation for automated customer support
- Best practices for weekend maintenance windows with global user base

### Customer Support Strategy

1. **Automated Chatbot:** First line of support for simple questions about workflows, platform features, and common issues
2. **Live Assistance Escalation:** Automatic routing to human support when chatbot cannot resolve the issue
3. **Maintenance Windows:** Platform maintenance scheduled for weekends only, never during trading days

### Platform Boundaries

- **No Clearing or Settlement:** Platform facilitates communication and trade agreement only
- **Confirmation Generation:** Automated confirmations sent to designated emails (front office, back office, compliance)
- **Member-to-Member:** All trades are bilateral between members who handle their own settlement
- **Pure Technology Front-End:** No involvement in actual trade execution or post-trade processes
